# Evaluation environment

* `build-venv-ecole.sh` creates a virtual environment with SCIP + ecole
installed. Requires `download-libs.sh` run first to get package sources.
* `Dockerfile` is mainly there to test the virtualenv build; may be useful
to provide to participants so that it's clear what headers/libraries are
available for any python packages they might install?

Participants code might be allowed to provide an additional requirements.txt
for packages to be installed. Beyond that it should be runnable in this
virtualenv as-is.

## To Do

* Add some standard packages beyond numpy/scipy to ensure common usage is
supported?
